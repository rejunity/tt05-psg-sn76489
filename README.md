# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

## Wokwi Projects

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the wokwi_id to the ID of your Wokwi project. You can find the ID in the URL of your project, it's the big number after `wokwi.com/projects/`.

The GitHub action will automatically fetch the digital netlist from Wokwi and build the ASIC files.

## Verilog Projects

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and uncomment the `source_files` and `top_module` properties, and change the value of `language` to "Verilog". Add your Verilog files to the `src` folder, and list them in the `source_files` property.

The GitHub action will automatically build the ASIC files using [OpenLane](https://www.zerotoasiccourse.com/terminology/openlane/).

## How to enable the GitHub actions to build the ASIC files
