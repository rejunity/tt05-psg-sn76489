project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
  source_files:
    - attenuation.v
    - tone.v
    - noise.v
    - signal_edge.v
    - pwm.v
    - tt_um_rejunity_sn76489.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_rejunity_sn76489"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do
  bidirectional:
    - /WE - (in) inverted write enable
    - SEL0 - (in) 0 = SN76489 clock divided by 16, 1 = SN94624/SN76494 without clock divider
    - SEL1 - (in) 0 = SN76489 clock divided by 16, 1 = clock divided by 128
